Before the proofs that are the main results of this thesis we will start with a formal introduction of partizan poset games in general and partizan poset games played on chess-colored Young diagrams in particular.
%\\
\begin{defn}[Partizan Poset Games]
Let $P$ be any colored poset and let $p_L,p_R$ denote arbitrary elements in $P$ of Left and Right respectively. The partizan poset game $G_{\rm PP}(P)$ played on $P$ is a partizan two-player game where the Left player has the option to select any white element $p_L$ in $P$ and then remove $p_L$ together with all elements greater than $p_L$ and equivalently for the Right player but with black elements in $P$. More formally we have:
\begin{align*}
&G_{\rm PP}(P)=\{L|R\}&~\\
&L=\{G_{\rm PP}(P\setminus S_{\rm P}(p_L)):p_L\in P\text{ is white}\}&~\\
&R=\{G_{\rm PP}(P\setminus S_{\rm P}(p_R)):p_R\in P\text{ is black}\}&\\
&S_{\rm P}(p)=\{p':p'\in P,p'\ge p\}&~
\end{align*}
\end{defn}
~\\
More specifically, this thesis deals with partizan poset games played on posets that are chess-colored and in the form of Young diagrams. We will denote such a game, with $k\ge1$ rows in the Young diagram, as $A_\lambda$, where $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_k)$ is as in Definition \ref{def:lambda} and $\lambda_1\ge \lambda_2\ge \dots\ge \lambda_k$ denotes the lengths of the 1st, 2nd,$\dots,k$'th rows respectively. In particular, when $k=3$ or $k=2$, we will use the notation $A_{x,y,z}$ and $A_{x,y}$ respectively.

\subsection{All Poset Games Are Numbers}
As it is, we have that all poset games are numbers. In particular, for a large number of partizan poset games, the value is bounded.% as $0\le G\le 1$.
%According to Section \ref{section:numbers} in general and Theorem \ref{numthm} in particular, it is, using \emph{Conway Induction}, sufficient to show that for a poset game $G$ we have $G^L<G^R$.
%\\
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:posetnum}
All poset games are numbers.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof2}{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:posetnum}}
Assume that we have an arbitrary poset game $G$. Using \emph{Conway Induction} (Theorem \ref{thm:conind}) it suffices to assume that $G^L,G^R$ are numbers and then deduce that $G$ is a number as well. By Theorem \ref{thm:number} it is then sufficient to show that $G^L<G^R$ for all options of $G$.
\\
If we can show that $G^L<G$ and $G^R>G$ for any Left and Right options of $G$, then it also holds that $G^L<G^R$, and hence $G$ must be a number.
\\\\
Consider the scenario where Left moves to some option $G^{L_1}$, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:posetnum1}. We have that $G^{L_1}<G$ since Right always wins in $G^{L_1}-G$.

\captionof{figure}{Arbitrary poset game $G$ and $G$ with an arbitrary Left option $G^{L_1}$.}
\label{fig:posetnum1}
\end{figure} 

This is easily understood from the following. In the game $G^{L_1}-G$ in Figure \ref{fig:posetnum2} the Right player wins if it plays first, since then Right can move to $-G^{L_1}$ in $-G$ and then mimic Left's moves until Left has no moves left. If Left starts and plays in the part of $G$ that is not included in $G^{L_1}$, i.e., the small appendage of G in Figure \ref{fig:posetnum1}, then Right can move to $-G^{L_1}$ in that component and copy Left in the same way as before. If Left starts and plays in the $G^{L_1}$-part of either component, then Right can copy Left until either Left has no moves or until Left plays in the appendage part of the $-G$ component, and then Right can just move to the option that removes that appendage, which makes the two components mirrored again, so Right can then copy Left until Left has no moves and loses.
\\
Since Right wins in $G^{L_1}-G$ no matter if Right starts or not, then $G^{L_1}-G<0$.

\captionof{figure}{The poset game $G^{L_1}-G$.}
\label{fig:posetnum2}
\end{figure}
%\\
In the exact same way, it is possible to show that Left always wins in $G^{R_1}-G$, and hence that $G^{R_1}-G>0$. We therefore have $G^{L_1}<G^{R_1}$. Since $G^{L_1}$ and $G^{R_1}$ were arbitrary, this holds for any Left and Right options $G^{L_1},G^{R_1}$, and therefore $G$ must be a number.
\end{proof2}

This lets us know that all poset games are numbers. But we can also bound the value of some partizan poset games, as will be seen in Theorem \ref{thm:value}.

\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{thm}
Any partizan poset game $G$ with a single smallest element colored white, covered only by black elements, has a value $0< G< 1$. 
\\
An example game can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:partizanvalue}.

%\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{proof2}{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:value}}
Let $G$ be any partizan poset game with a single smallest element colored white, covered only by black elements. Clearly $G>0$ since Left can remove the smallest element in the poset, removing all elements, resulting in no options for Right, so Left wins. 
\\
Moreover, since the game with only the smallest (white) element left is either an option of Right, or an option of an option of Right, or an option of an option of an option of Right,\dots, etc., and all $G^R>G$, then $G<1$.
\end{proof2}
%Obviously, the value of games for which the coloring is reversed that of Theorem \ref{thm:value} is also bounded, but as $0>G>-1$ instead. 
%\\
We may note that this theorem holds for all chess-colored partizan poset games with a single smallest elements, e.g., games played on chess-colored Young diagrams.
\\\\
In addition to bounding the value of some games, it is also possible to determine that a player should try to play the option of removing as great elements as possible.
\begin{thm}[Play Strategy]
\label{thm:playstrategy}
A player should only play the options of removing elements not lower than any other element of the same color.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof2}{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:playstrategy}}
We will prove this theorem by showing that any option of removing an element that is lower than some other element of the same color is also a dominated option. 
\\
Let $G$ be any partizan poset game, let $G^{L_{x_1}},G^{L_{x_2}}$ be the Left options when removing the elements $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively and let $x_1>x_2$.
The option $G^{L_{x_2}}$ must be an option of $G^{L_{x_1}}$. This is because $x_1>x_2$, which yields that the option of removing $x_2$ also removes $x_1$, and therefore the option of removing $x_1$ does not remove any elements that are not removed when playing the option of removing $x_2$. 
\\
Since $G^{L_{x_2}}$ is an option of $G^{L_{x_1}}$ and Theorem \ref{thm:posetnum} yields that $G$ is a number, then $G^{L_{x_1}}>G^{L_{x_2}}$ and hence $G^{L_{x_2}}$ is dominated by $G^{L_{x_1}}$, i.e., Left should not play the option $G^{L_{x_2}}$.
\\
Similarly, this holds for Right options as well.

%\subsection{Partizan Tree Poset Games And Blue-Red Hackenbush}
%\begin{thm}
%A Partizan tree poset game where no element is covering more than one element is equivalent to a game of Blue-Red Hackenbush.
%\end{thm}
%\begin{proof2}
%Consider a partizan tree poset game $G$. Then transform every element in the poset of $G$ to a stick in the game of Blue-Red Hackenbush, color them according to the appropriate player, connect every stick with the stick that it covers and connect the least element to the ground. We then have an equivalent game of Blue-Red Hackenbush.

\subsection{Chess-Colored Young Diagram Partizan Poset Games}
For chess-colored Young diagrams, we have a very regular structure. This regularity makes it possible to reduce the games significantly, and make even stronger statements about the values of these games. A general result about how we can reduce games played on chess-colored Young diagrams is the following.

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:chessdomopt}
The dominating option of $A_\lambda$, with $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_k)$, is always to remove the greatest element of your color in one of the rows.
\end{lem}
~\\
Lemma \ref{lem:chessdomopt} follows from Theorem \ref{thm:playstrategy}. For a better understanding of what the lemma yields, we will provide some examples of the concept. 
\begin{ex}{}
Let $k=4$. With $\lambda_1=9,\lambda_2=7,\lambda_3=7,\lambda_4=2$, Lemma \ref{lem:chessdomopt} gives us that: $$A_{9,7,7,2}=\left\{A_{8,7,7,2},A_{9,5,5,2},A_{9,7,6,2},A_{9,7,7,1}\middle|A_{7,7,7,2},A_{9,6,6,2},A_{9,7,5,2},A_{9,7,7,0}\right\}.$$
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}{}
For $x=y=3,z=1$ Lemma \ref{lem:chessdomopt} gives us $$A_{3,3,1}=\left\{A_{2,2,1},A_{3,1,1},A_{3,3,0}\middle|A_{1,1,1},A_{3,2,1}\right\},$$ as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:chessdomex}.

%Lemma \ref{lem:chessdomopt} follows from Theorem \ref{thm:playstrategy}, but we will provide an explicit proof and prove Lemma \ref{lem:chessdomopt} using Theorem \ref{thm:number} by showing that options when removing non-maximal elements are options of a option when a maximal element is removed, and must therefore be dominated by this option. 
%\begin{proof2}{Proof of Lemma \ref{lem:chessdomopt}}
%Let $G=A_\lambda$, with $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_k)$, and let $G^{L_i},i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ denote an arbitrary option of Left when playing in the $i$'th row and $G^{R_i},i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ denote an arbitrary option of Right when playing in the $i$'th row. Let $G^{L_i^{max}},G^{R_i^{max}}$ denote the game options of $G$ when removing the greatest white and black element respectively in the $i$'th row for players Left and Right. \\
%We will then have that $G^{L_i^{max}}>G^{L_i}$ for any other option for Left in the $i$'th row. This is because any other Left option when playing in the $i$'th row except removing the greatest Left element is a game option of $G^{L_i^{max}}$ and by Theorem \ref{thm:number} we have $G^{L_i^{max}L}<G^{L_i^{max}}$. The same argument also gives us that $G^{R_i^{max}}<G^{R_i}$ for all other Right options of playing in the $i$'th row. Therefore $G^{L_1^{max}},G^{L_2^{max}},G^{L_3^{max}}, G^{R_1^{max}},G^{R_2^{max}},G^{R_3^{max}}$ must be the dominating game options of $G$, and hence Lemma \ref{lem:chessdomopt} is valid for $G$ itself.
